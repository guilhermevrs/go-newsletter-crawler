Nobody cares about your beautiful code 
( https://programmingdigest.net/links/10146/redirect?subscriber_id=aa84539e-a5c7-4fc1-9e51-235b2aab5e1c&utm_medium=email )


Companies need to make a tradeoff between “move fast and
break things” or grow in a steady, sustainable and healthy pace
and be eaten up by competition. In the end, it’s all about which
startup is able to move faster and adapt quicker until they
finally achieve enough traction to then take a step back and
reevaluate early technical decisions.

Understanding quantum computing through drunken walks 
( https://programmingdigest.net/links/10154/redirect?subscriber_id=aa84539e-a5c7-4fc1-9e51-235b2aab5e1c&utm_medium=email )


The jumping off point for exploring quantum computing is to
understand that while many of the principles are
counterintuitive, the classical universe we know and love is but
a mere shadow of the quantum fabric of reality. To get a feel for
that fundamental difference we will walk through an example that
helps to illustrate the power of quantum computation.

You might as well timestamp it 
( https://programmingdigest.net/links/10166/redirect?subscriber_id=aa84539e-a5c7-4fc1-9e51-235b2aab5e1c&utm_medium=email )


Future-you will be glad you stored a timestamp instead of
that boolean.

Use Google like a pro 
( https://programmingdigest.net/links/10161/redirect?subscriber_id=aa84539e-a5c7-4fc1-9e51-235b2aab5e1c&utm_medium=email )


Googling is one of the most important skills for every
developer. Let me show you how to get better at Googling.

The compiler writer resource page 
( https://programmingdigest.net/links/10136/redirect?subscriber_id=aa84539e-a5c7-4fc1-9e51-235b2aab5e1c&utm_medium=email )


I know complete pans of the literature are left out, but this
is a page for amateur compiler writers. Anything that I did not
find practical is not listed here. (I also did not include the
things that I do not yet know!) All the remarks in grey and even
the selection of documents are personal. If you have suggestions
of papers to include, please contact me! Finally, the order of
items in the various sections is totally arbitrary.
