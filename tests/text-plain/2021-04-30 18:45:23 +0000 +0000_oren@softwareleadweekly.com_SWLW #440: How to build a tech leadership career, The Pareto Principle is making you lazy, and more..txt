13 minutes read.
"As the industry we’re in gets older, lots of folks are trying to develop themselves without moving into people management" -- I think that Will Larson is doing a remarkable job laying out how to approach complex problems. This interview with him covers his approach to building a career ladder for ICs (worth reading his book!) that you can apply in your organization.

How to Hire an Engineering Manager: From Within or Without? (https://leaddev.com/hiring-onboarding-retention/how-hire-engineering-manager-within-or-without)
7 minutes read.
Charity Majors provides the questions and mindset to explore when considering hiring a new manager - from within the organization or someone external. "Managers should have a chat about career plans with everyone on their team at least once or twice a year, and that includes asking whether they would like to try being a manager at some point." -- This is important as you want to understand the potential within your team. Don't wait until it's too late.

The Process Is Not the Product — The Software Methodology Anti-Manifesto. (https://mkarliner.medium.com/the-process-is-not-the-product-the-new-agile-anti-manifesto-d3e23023b466)
3 minutes read.
This is so good and precise: "In a (very) long technical career, I must have been exposed to the majority of software methodologies, and experience has shown that they are, by and large, more of a liability than a help. In fact, I’ll go further and say that I think that too much methodology is much more dangerous than too little." -- You won't agree necessarily with everything that Michael Karliner writes, but he will make you think about your approach to setting processes.

Make Boring Plans (https://skamille.medium.com/make-boring-plans-9438ce5cb053)

"When we don’t attend to the boring parts by making our plans predictable, the interesting parts turn into extra stress on top of the overwhelming anxiety of juggling these moves." -- Camille Fournier shares how to approach planning by better understanding your current project phase and communicate (expectations, progress, deliverables, etc.) accordingly.

The Pareto Principle Is Making You Lazy (https://www.swyx.io/8020/)
3 minutes read.
"It took me years of hard work to become an overnight success" is something successful makers often say. Sure, ask yourself if you're working on the right things to reduce risk or maximize impact. But don't stop after the 20% to endlessly (and aimlessly) chase higher leverage activity. Worry more about poor finish to start ratio.

And finally, inspiring tweets...

------------------------------------------------------------

@DenehyXXL (https://twitter.com/DenehyXXL/status/1387106815150809094) : Spoiler alert. Just focus on becoming excellent at recruiting and your odds of building a great company go up exponentially.
@alphacolin (https://twitter.com/alphacolin/status/1385310897929744387) : One of the most high leverage things you can do in life is to work on dealing with your own baggage. Everyone else is bringing their own baggage in to everything they do. That doesn’t excuse bad behavior but it can help you navigate it knowing it’s probably not about you.
