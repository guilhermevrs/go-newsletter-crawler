Treat your onboarding process like your build system 
( https://techleaddigest.net/links/10156/redirect?subscriber_id=8df220c8-6c84-4209-ab48-b7d85c8020b6&utm_medium=email )


Whether you have one, ten, or a hundred engineers, a scalable
onboarding process is a very high leverage activity with
immediate results and has great return on investment over time.

Adding is favoured over subtracting in problem solving 
( https://techleaddigest.net/links/10155/redirect?subscriber_id=8df220c8-6c84-4209-ab48-b7d85c8020b6&utm_medium=email )


A series of problem-solving experiments reveal that people
are more likely to consider solutions that add features than
solutions that remove them, even when removing features is more
efficient.

Three feedback models 
( https://techleaddigest.net/links/10158/redirect?subscriber_id=8df220c8-6c84-4209-ab48-b7d85c8020b6&utm_medium=email )


Giving feedback is perhaps the most important part of a
manager’s job. Feedback is the main mechanism by which managers
help the folks on their team improve, so effective feedback leads
to individual career growth and better team results: win-win.

Why shared services don’t work with agility 
( https://techleaddigest.net/links/10117/redirect?subscriber_id=8df220c8-6c84-4209-ab48-b7d85c8020b6&utm_medium=email )


One of my clients wants to use shared services “teams” as
they start their agile transformation. Their developers work on a
product for months and years at a time.

Start your new team off on the right foot 
( https://techleaddigest.net/links/10125/redirect?subscriber_id=8df220c8-6c84-4209-ab48-b7d85c8020b6&utm_medium=email )


You’ve just taken a role as a team lead. While most leaders
double down on setting clearer goals to rally the team, this is
only half the picture. The underlying elements – like values,
strengths, and behaviors – are what you really need to address to
bond and perform as a team.
